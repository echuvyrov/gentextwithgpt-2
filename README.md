# Generating reading level-appropriate text with fine-tuned GPT-2 Transformer
This Jupyter notebook (used in Azure Data Science VM) contains code to pre-process CBT dataset for appropriate reading level based on Fleschâ€“Kincaid Grade Readability score.

It then trains a fine-tuned GPT-2 transformer on the pre-processed training data and tries to generate reading level-appropriate sentences.
